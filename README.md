# 2-STEP VERIFICATION SMART SAFE

# Hello everyone! Welcome to my github. This past 2019 Fall semester, my group and I created a 2-Step Verification Smart Safe for our 
# senior project at San Francisco State University. We were able to win second place at our school's annual project showcase meaning that # we believe a lot of people were fascinated and impressed with our project. Therefore we believed that we should share our work with you # so that you can get a chance to build your own smart safe!

# We wrote our program using Python 3 on the Raspberry Pi 3. We also used various components for our project and you can take a look at 
# them at our website: https://sites.google.com/view/smart-safe/home

# The code provided includes Tkinter GUI and Facial Recognition for our 4" touch screen LCD that was used as the main interface on the 
# safe. Please note that we were guided through a tutorial in order to download the facial recognition libraries.
